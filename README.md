# CNN Landmark Classification Project 


## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the locations of images based on discernible landmarks. It aims to address the challenge faced by photo-sharing services when location metadata is unavailable, enabling automatic tagging and organization of images.

## Objectives

- Build a CNN model to detect and classify landmarks in user-supplied images.
- Create a user-friendly application that suggests the top k relevant landmarks from a predefined set of 50 landmarks worldwide.
- Understand the complexities of developing a data processing pipeline with multiple models.


## Motivation

With the increasing number of images uploaded to various platforms, the lack of location metadata poses a significant challenge. This project seeks to leverage deep learning to automate the location inference process, enhancing user experience with improved tagging and organization of photos.

This project is for the CNN Udacity course.
